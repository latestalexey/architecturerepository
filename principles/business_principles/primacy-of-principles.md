# Primacy of Principles

### Statement

These principles of information management apply to all organisations within the enterprise.

### Rationale

The only way we can provide a consistent and measurable level of quality information to decision-makers is if all organisations abide by the principles.

### Implications

* Without this principle, exclusions, favouritism, and inconsistency would rapidly undermine the management of information
* Information management initiatives will not begin until they are examined for compliance with the principles
* A conflict with a principle will be resolved by changing the framework of the initiative
