# Summary
At their best, standards extend the reach of design patterns by ensuring that different
implementations of the same pattern are interoperable. Many efforts are underway to extend
messaging patterns through web service standards; many of these standards focus on the
composition and behavior of workflow components called business process components.
Standards such as BPEL, WSCI, and the WS-* specifications tackle many of the problems
described in this book, and implement several of the patterns in this pattern language.

Still, the emerging standards stories are occasionally conflicting and can be confusing. They're
certainly not all ready for prime time. When applying a pattern, an application developer should
avoid getting bogged down by standards and stay focused instead on the particular use cases at
hand. Take a look at how certain standards are approaching a problem, and adopt those tactical,
idiomatic implementations of a pattern if it makes sense, or if it's helpful during implementation
-- regardless of whether the approach is standardized across vendor products. Developers can
also provide feedback to standards organizations to challenge, criticize, and otherwise ensure
that standards become practically useful and not academic or vendor exercises. As standards
mature, architects are wise to consider how their use might extend enterprise integration
solutions to broader, less risky, less costly, and more powerful levels of sophistication.
